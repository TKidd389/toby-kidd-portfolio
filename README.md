Within my CV folder (GitHub CV), you will find two projects performing a Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation in Imaginary Time using the Metropolis Method, and the other simulating a quantum wave pocket in different potentials.

Due to the iterative nature of the Monte Carlo algorithm used, the parameters have been set so that each run should take roughly 60 seconds for convenience.
