Quantum Wave Packet Simulations

Within my CV folder (GitHub CV), you will find two projects performing a Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation in Imaginary Time using the Metropolis Method, and the other simulating a quantum wave pocket in different potentials.

Due to the iterative nature of the Monte Carlo algorithm used, the parameters have been set so that each run should take roughly 60 seconds for convenience.

***The full code for the Machine Learning will be pushed to Github soon
I have also included the code for my ongoing Master project in Mathematical Physics (using machine learning methods [CNN, diffusion models, etc.] to perform operations on the CAMELS Multifield Dataset).
The code uses DDPM, DDIM models to produce high-quality 2D maps of galaxy clusters, and uses various statistical analysis methods to assess the quality of generated images. These tests include a trained CNN model, which predicts the cosmological parameter(s) used to generate the images.
